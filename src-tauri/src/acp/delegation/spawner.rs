//! `ConnectionSpawner` trait — the subset of `ConnectionManager` capabilities
//! that the delegation broker needs. Defined as a trait so:
//!
//! 1. The broker can be unit-tested with a `MockSpawner` (no real ACP
//!    processes, no DB writes).
//! 2. Future cross-host / remote-agent work (v3+) can plug in a different
//!    backend without touching the broker.
//!
//! The concrete impl on `Arc<ConnectionManager>` lives in
//! `acp::manager` next to the existing `ConnectionManager` methods to keep
//! the manager's surface area contiguous.
